# Robocopy
The Microsoft Windows's file replication command with a basic user interface, made in C# using WPF. I started this project with the idea of making it easier to use, without the need to open the Windows console. 

# Overview
By simply selecting the source and destination, with one of the copy options, you can run robocopy and check the progress on the console.

# To be fixed
<li>Still struggling to kill cmd process after the user decides to close the app</li>
<li>Visuals</li>

# Future functionalities
<li>More copy options</li>
<li>Language change</li>
